## 🔑 Login Credentials

Email: hr@staffsync.com
Password: demo123
```

### Employee Portal
**You have two options:**

**Option 1: Create Your Own Account (Recommended)**

- Click "Sign Up" on the homepage
- Fill in your details
- Login with your new credentials

**Option 2: Use Dummy Employee Account**

Password: employee123
```

> **Note:** Creating your own account is recommended to experience the full registration flow and have personalized data.

## ⚠️ Important: About the Data

**The application is fully dynamic and functional** - all data is stored in a real PostgreSQL database and can be created, updated, and deleted through the interface.

**Dummy Data for Testing:**
The HR portal currently shows 4 pre-loaded employees with Indian names. This dummy data was added for testing and demonstration purposes only. The system is **not static** - you can:
- Add new employees
- Edit existing employee information
- Delete employees
- Mark attendance
- All changes are saved to the database in real-time

The dummy data simply provides a starting point to explore the features without having to manually create test data.
